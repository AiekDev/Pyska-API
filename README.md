# Pyska-API
Pyska-API is a Discord Bot

This version doesn't have all the features the original Pyska-API Bot had because you're supposed to be original yk? (and also because if u wanna make your own Pyska-API, at the very least you would be a bit original and add your commands)

## Commands
**FOR MODERATION**
/ban - Requirement : Ban permission/Administrator

/purge (deletes messages) - Requirement : Manage Messages permission
