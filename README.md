# Pyska-API
Pyska-API is a Discord Bot
This version doesn't have all the features the original Pyska-API Bot had because I don't want anyone to skid off it (and also because if u wanna make your own Pyska-API, at the very least you would be a bit original and add your commands)

## Commands
- /help
- /pyskapicture (sends a picture of aiek's cat)
- /pyskavideo (sends a video of aiek's cat)
- /chatgpt (chatgpt no way!!!)
- /about (gives credits)

## Credits:
- Aiek (Owner)
- RoboM101 (Contributor)
- CozmoDev (Thanks for the README!!!)
